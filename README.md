# Minecraft 2D in C++ with SFML

<!-- ![Gameplay Screenshot](screenshot.png) -->

## Introduction

This project is a 2D version inspired by the mechanics of Minecraft, implemented from scratch in C++ using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML). The game aims to replicate some core features of Minecraft in a 2D environment.

## Features

- **Terrain Generation**: Procedurally generated 2D world with different types of blocks.
- **Player Interaction**: Mining and placing blocks to modify the environment.
- **Crafting System**: Basic crafting mechanics to create tools or items.
- **Redstone Mechanisms**: Introduce redstone-like components for creating circuits and mechanisms.
- **Mob Interaction**: Encounter and interact with creatures within the world.
- **User Interface**: Minimal UI for inventory, health, and basic game information.

## Redstone Mechanisms

Redstone introduces electrical components that players can use to create complex systems:

- **Redstone Dust**: Placeable and conductive material used as wiring.
- **Redstone Torches**: Emits power and acts as a power source.
- **Repeaters and Comparators**: Control signal strength and timing in redstone circuits.
- **Pistons and Doors**: Mechanical components powered by redstone signals.
- **Logic Gates**: Create various logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) for complex circuitry.
- **Pressure Plates and Sensors**: Trigger mechanisms based on player movement or item placement.

Utilize these components creatively to design traps, automatic doors, secret passages, and various contraptions within the game world.

## Installation
> WIP

## Build

- Ensure you have SFML installed.
